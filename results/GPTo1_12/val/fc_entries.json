        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides data on the expenses for the Green Bay Packers over several years, but it does not specify the reasons behind the changes in expenses. Without additional context or breakdowns of the expenses, it is impossible to determine the specific factors contributing to the increase in 2017."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the expected spend for online sales in 2020 was approximately 5.76 billion GBP, significantly above 2. The visual representation of the blue bar for 2020 indicates a value much higher than the claim suggests."
