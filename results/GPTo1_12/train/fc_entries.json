        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart, which clearly shows 3 distinct bars on the 2nd tick from the top, representing the percentage of firms in different categories. The presence of 3 bars indicates that the claim about only 2 bars is incorrect."

        "explanation": "The chart provides data on the number of suicides by age group for each year, but it does not include information on the social or economic conditions that could have affected these numbers. Without this context, it is impossible to determine the specific reasons behind the total of 517 suicides in 2009."
