        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that the CPIA rating for social protection remained constant at approximately 2.5 from 2008 to 2012. Therefore, the rating in 2008 is equal to the rating in 2012, confirming that it is not less."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the expenses for 2017 were recorded at 376.1 million. By stating a higher figure, it misrepresents the actual data presented in the chart."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides specific percentages for North America, Europe, and South America, but does not include information about other potential regions or factors that could influence profit contributions. Without this data, it is unclear how the contributions from these regions interact or compare, making it impossible to fully assess the implications of the stated profit contributions."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart's visual representation, which clearly shows that the Y-axis values are displayed in standard numerical format rather than scientific notation. The presence of whole numbers indicates that the values are not expressed in E-notation, which typically involves a format like '1.0E+1' for 10."

        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the percentage of male workers in the industry sector in 1986 was significantly higher, at approximately 51.2%. The refuted claim misrepresents the data by suggesting a much lower percentage, which is not supported by the visual representation in the chart."
