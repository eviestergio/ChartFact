        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows the profit contributions from different regions: South America (42%), Europe (37%), and North America (21%). The maximum profit contribution is from South America at 42%, while the minimum is from North America at 21%. The difference between these two values is 42 - 21 = 21, which supports the claim."

        "label": "Refutes",

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides the expenses for the Green Bay Packers from 2014 to 2018, showing a general upward trend. However, it does not specify the reasons behind the changes in expenses, such as player salaries, operational costs, or other financial factors, making it impossible to determine the exact cause of the increase in 2017."

        "explanation": "The chart clearly shows that Google received a score of 79 index points, which is represented by the height of the blue bar corresponding to Google. This score is the highest among the listed search engines, indicating its strong performance on the ACSI index in 2020."
