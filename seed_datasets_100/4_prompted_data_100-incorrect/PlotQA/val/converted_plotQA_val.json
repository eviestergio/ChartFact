        "claim": "The total grants received by the government in Cote d'Ivoire is 548650000 US dollars.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This statement is supported by the chart, which shows the grants received by Cote d'Ivoire over the years. The data point corresponding to Cote d'Ivoire indicates a total of 548650000 US dollars, clearly marked on the vertical axis of the graph."

        "claim": "The values on the major ticks of the Y-axis are displayed in scientific E-notation.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart because the Y-axis clearly shows numerical values in standard decimal format, not in scientific notation. The absence of E-notation indicates that the values are presented in a straightforward manner, which is visually evident in the chart."

        "claim": "The chart does not specify the total population of the undernourished individuals in each country for 1992, which is necessary to determine the overall caloric needs.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "Without knowing the population size of the undernourished in each country, we cannot assess whether the stated minimum total calories of 89.0 is sufficient or accurate. The chart only provides calorie needs per person, but not the total number of individuals affected."

        "claim": "The CPIA rating of social protection in 2008 is not less than that in 2012.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that the CPIA rating for social protection remained constant at approximately 2.5 from 2008 to 2012. Since the rating did not decrease during this period, it confirms that the rating in 2008 is not less than that in 2012."

        "claim": "The percentage of male workers in industry in 1986 was only 30.5%.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the percentage of male workers in the industry sector in 1986 was significantly higher, at approximately 51.2%. The visual data indicates a stable trend around this percentage, making the claim of 30.5% inaccurate."
