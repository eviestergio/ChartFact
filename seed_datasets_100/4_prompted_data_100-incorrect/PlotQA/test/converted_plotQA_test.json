        "claim": "The difference between the highest and the lowest total amount earned by exporting goods and services in Uganda is 34,564,811.28.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This sentence is supported by the chart data, which indicates the total amounts earned from exports over a specified period. The highest value recorded is significantly greater than the lowest, resulting in a difference of 34,564,811.28, as calculated from the respective data points."

        "claim": "The difference between the highest and the second highest net bilateral aid flow in 1997 is 15000000.0.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim contradicts the chart's data by significantly underreporting the difference between the highest and second highest values. The chart clearly shows that the difference is much larger, indicating that the refuted claim misrepresents the actual figures presented."

    {
        "image": "plotQA_1467-test.png",
        "claim": "The chart does not specify the total population for each year, making it unclear how the rural population percentage is calculated.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "Without knowing the total population for each year, we cannot determine the significance of the rural population figures presented. This lack of context prevents us from fully understanding the implications of the data shown in the chart."

        "claim": "The number of bars on each tick of the X-axis is equal.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart displays the neonatal mortality rates for four countries (Azerbaijan, Haiti, Israel, and Panama) across several years. Each year on the X-axis has the same number of bars representing the countries, indicating that the number of bars is consistent across all ticks."

        "claim": "The graph shows a decline in the time spent dealing with government regulations over the years.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart because the graph clearly illustrates an upward trend in the time spent, indicating that the percentage of senior management time dedicated to dealing with government regulations has increased rather than decreased."
