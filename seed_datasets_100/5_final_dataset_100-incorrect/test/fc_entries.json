        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This sentence is supported by the chart data, which indicates the total amounts earned from exports over a specified period. The highest value recorded is significantly greater than the lowest, resulting in a difference of 34,564,811.28, as calculated from the respective data points."

        "claim": "South Sudan has the lowest access to electricity over the years compared to the other countries shown in the chart.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart illustrates the share of the population with access to electricity from 1990 to 1999 for various countries. South Sudan's line remains consistently at the lowest percentage, indicating that it has the least access to electricity compared to other countries like Jamaica and Eritrea, which show higher percentages of access."

        "claim": "The chart does not specify the total population for each year, making it unclear how the rural population percentage is calculated.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "Without knowing the total population for each year, we cannot determine the significance of the rural population figures presented. This lack of context prevents us from fully understanding the implications of the data shown in the chart."

        "claim": "The male population of Tunisia in 2019 was 5.8 million.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This statement is supported by the chart, which shows the male population in Tunisia increasing over the years, with a specific data point indicating that in 2019, the male population reached 5.8 million, as marked on the black line representing males."

        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart displays the neonatal mortality rates for four countries (Azerbaijan, Haiti, Israel, and Panama) across several years. Each year on the X-axis has the same number of bars representing the countries, indicating that the number of bars is consistent across all ticks."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim contradicts the chart's data by significantly underreporting the difference between the highest and second highest values. The chart clearly shows that the difference is much larger, indicating that the refuted claim misrepresents the actual figures presented."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "According to the chart, the combined population of Africa (227.79 million), Northern America (172.6 million), and South America (113.77 million) totals approximately 514.16 million, which is less than Europe's population of 549.33 million. Therefore, the claim that the total population in these regions exceeds that of Europe is incorrect."

        "explanation": "The chart provides specific revenue share percentages for Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo, but it does not include information on other potential competitors, market conditions, or timeframes that could affect these figures. Without this context, it is unclear whether Michael Kors's revenue share is stable, increasing, or influenced by external factors."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that 84% of Apple customers reported being very satisfied. By stating that only 50% are satisfied, it misrepresents the data presented in the chart."

        "claim": "The graph shows a decline in the time spent dealing with government regulations over the years.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart because the graph clearly illustrates an upward trend in the time spent, indicating that the percentage of senior management time dedicated to dealing with government regulations has increased rather than decreased."
