        "claim": "South Sudan has the lowest access to electricity over the years compared to other countries.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that South Sudan consistently has the lowest percentage of the population with access to electricity, remaining below 20% throughout the years displayed. In contrast, other countries like Jamaica and Eritrea have significantly higher access rates, with Jamaica exceeding 80% and Eritrea showing a gradual increase but still above South Sudan."

        "claim": "The total population in Africa, North America, and South America exceeds that of Europe.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart, which shows that Europe has a population of 549.33 million, while the combined populations of Africa (227.79 million), Northern America (172.6 million), and South America (113.77 million) total only 514.16 million. Therefore, the claim that the total population in these regions exceeds that of Europe is incorrect."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides specific revenue share percentages for Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo, but it does not include any contextual information about market conditions, consumer behavior, or other external factors that could affect these figures. Without this additional context, it is unclear whether the revenue share is solely due to the brand's performance or influenced by other variables."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart, which shows that 84% of Apple customers reported being very satisfied. By stating a lower satisfaction rate, it directly undermines the data presented in the chart."
