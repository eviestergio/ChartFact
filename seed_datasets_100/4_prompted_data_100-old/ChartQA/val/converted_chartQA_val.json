        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "Referring to the table data, South America's profit contribution is recorded as 42%, while North America's profit contribution is recorded as 21%. The difference between these two values is indeed 21%, directly supporting the claim made."

        "claim": "The year the green bar is below 2 is 2019.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim refutes the chart as it inaccurately states that the year the green bar is below 2 is 2019. However, according to the chart, the green bar is below 2 in 2016 with a value of 2.79, in 2017 with a value of 3.13, and in 2018 with a value of 3.48. Therefore, the claim contradicts the actual data presented in the chart."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim presents a possible explanation for the high expenses in 2017 without any specific data to confirm or refute this hypothesis. The chart only provides the expenses for each year without further details on what may have contributed to the amount in 2017, requiring additional information to verify this claim."

        "explanation": "By referring to the table in the chart, it is evident that Google received a score of 79 ACSI index points in 2020, confirming that Google's ranking was indeed 79 as stated in the claim."

        "claim": "35.9 smart home devices were sold to dealers in the United States in 2017.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim refutes the chart as it inaccurately states that 35.9 smart home devices were sold in 2017. However, based on the data in the chart, the actual value for smart home devices sold in 2017 is 35.9, not 35.9. Therefore, the claim directly contradicts the factual information presented in the chart."
