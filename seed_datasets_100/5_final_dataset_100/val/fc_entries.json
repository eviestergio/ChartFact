        "claim": "Only 10.5 smart home devices were sold to dealers in the United States in 2014.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that 20.7 million smart home devices were sold in 2014. The number 10.5 is significantly lower than the reported figure, thus refuting the claim made by the chart."

        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This statement is supported by the chart, which shows the grants received by Cote d'Ivoire over the years. The data point corresponding to Cote d'Ivoire indicates a total of 548650000 US dollars, clearly marked on the vertical axis of the graph."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the percentage of male workers in the industry sector in 1986 was significantly higher, at approximately 51.2%. The visual data indicates a stable trend around this percentage, making the claim of 30.5% inaccurate."

        "claim": "The CPIA rating of social protection in 2008 is not less than that in 2012.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that the CPIA rating for social protection remained constant at approximately 2.5 from 2008 to 2012. Since the rating did not decrease during this period, it confirms that the rating in 2008 is not less than that in 2012."

        "claim": "The difference between maximum profit contribution and minimum profit contribution is 21.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows the profit contributions from different regions: South America (42%), Europe (37%), and North America (21%). The maximum profit contribution is from South America at 42%, while the minimum is from North America at 21%. The difference between these two values is 42 - 21 = 21, which supports the claim."

        "claim": "The blue bar was below 5 in the year 2020.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the value of the blue bar (representing online spending) in 2020 is approximately 5.76 billion GBP, indicating it is above 5."

        "claim": "In 2020, Google's ranking on the ACSI index was 79 out of 100 points.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart clearly shows that Google received a score of 79 index points, which is represented by the height of the blue bar corresponding to Google. This score is the highest among the listed search engines, indicating its strong performance on the ACSI index in 2020."

        "claim": "The values on the major ticks of the Y-axis are displayed in scientific E-notation.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This statement contradicts the chart because the Y-axis clearly shows numerical values in standard decimal format, not in scientific notation. The absence of E-notation indicates that the values are presented in a straightforward manner, which is visually evident in the chart."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides the expenses for the Green Bay Packers from 2014 to 2018, showing a general upward trend. However, it does not specify the reasons behind the changes in expenses, such as player salaries, operational costs, or other financial factors, making it impossible to determine the exact cause of the increase in 2017."

        "image": "plotQA_27994-val.png",
        "claim": "The chart does not specify the total population of the undernourished individuals in each country for 1992, which is necessary to determine the overall caloric needs.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "Without knowing the population size of the undernourished in each country, we cannot assess whether the stated minimum total calories of 89.0 is sufficient or accurate. The chart only provides calorie needs per person, but not the total number of individuals affected."
