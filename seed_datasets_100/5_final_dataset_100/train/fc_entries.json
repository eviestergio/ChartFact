The presence of 4 bars is essential to the data being presented, and stating there are only 2 bars misrepresents the information."

The chart displays three bars for each country, representing the years 1980, 1981, and 1982. Since each country has the same number of bars (three) for each tick on the Y-axis, it confirms that the number of bars on each tick is indeed equal."
