        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart illustrates the share of the population with access to electricity from 1990 to 1999 for various countries. South Sudan's line remains consistently at the lowest percentage, indicating that it has the least access to electricity compared to other countries like Jamaica and Eritrea, which show higher percentages of access."

        "claim": "The total population in Africa, North America, and South America exceeds that of Europe.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "According to the chart, the combined population of Africa (227.79 million), Northern America (172.6 million), and South America (113.77 million) totals approximately 514.16 million, which is less than Europe's population of 549.33 million. Therefore, the claim that the total population in these regions exceeds that of Europe is incorrect."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides specific revenue share percentages for Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo, but it does not include information on other potential competitors, market conditions, or timeframes that could affect these figures. Without this context, it is unclear whether Michael Kors's revenue share is stable, increasing, or influenced by external factors."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that 84% of Apple customers reported being very satisfied. By stating that only 50% are satisfied, it misrepresents the data presented in the chart."
