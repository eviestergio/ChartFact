        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "By analyzing the data in the chart, it is evident that South Sudan consistently has the lowest values for access to electricity compared to the other countries listed.

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim refutes the chart as it inaccurately states that the population in Asia, Europe, and South America combined exceeds the total population of Northern America and Africa. However, according to the data in the table, the population of Asia, Europe, and South America is 664.51, whereas the total population of Northern America and Africa is 400.39. Therefore, the claim contradicts the actual data presented in the chart."

        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "This claim speculates on factors not present in the chart data, such as seasonal sales variations. The chart only provides the current share of revenue without any reference to seasonal trends or specific influencing factors, making it impossible to confirm or deny the impact of unique seasonal sales patterns on Michael Kors' market share."

        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim refutes the chart as it incorrectly states that Apple customers were very satisfied at a rate of 30%. However, according to the chart, the actual percentage of Apple customers reporting very satisfied was 84%. Therefore, the claim contradicts the factual data presented in the chart."
