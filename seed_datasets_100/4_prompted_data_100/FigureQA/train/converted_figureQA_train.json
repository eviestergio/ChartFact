        "claim": "Cornflower is less than Light Slate.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that the value for Light Slate is significantly higher than that for Cornflower. Light Slate has a value close to 100, while Cornflower has a value of approximately 30. This clearly indicates that Cornflower is less than Light Slate."

        "claim": "Green Yellow is less than Orchid.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart, which clearly shows that the value for Green Yellow is higher than that for Orchid. The bar representing Green Yellow is significantly taller than the one for Orchid, indicating that Green Yellow has a greater value."

        "claim": "The roughness levels of colors other than Dark Violet are not specified.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart provides data on various colors and their corresponding values, but it does not indicate the specific roughness levels for each color. Without this information, it is impossible to determine how Dark Violet compares to other colors in terms of roughness."

        "image": "figureQA_43461-train.png",
        "claim": "Medium Seafoam is not the high median.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that Medium Seafoam occupies a smaller portion of the total compared to other segments, indicating that it does not represent the highest median value among the categories presented."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_37961-train.png",
        "claim": "Olive is not the maximum; Dark Turquoise has a larger portion.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "The chart visually represents the proportions of different colors, and Dark Turquoise occupies a larger segment compared to Olive. This indicates that Dark Turquoise has a greater value or representation than Olive, directly contradicting the claim that Olive is the maximum."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_51171-train.png",
        "claim": "The chart does not provide context on the criteria used to determine the median values for each color.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "Without knowing how the median values were calculated or what specific data points were considered, it is unclear whether Steel Blue's position relative to other colors is significant or if it is influenced by external factors not represented in the chart."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_55737-train.png",
        "claim": "Chartreuse is the maximum value in the chart.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart displays four color categories with their corresponding values on the x-axis. Chartreuse has the longest bar, indicating it has the highest value compared to Web Gray, Medium Mint, and Magenta. This visual representation confirms that Chartreuse is indeed the maximum."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_19952-train.png",
        "claim": "Dark Cyan has the lowest median value among the colors listed.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart because Dark Cyan is represented by a bar that is significantly higher than several other colors, such as Indian Red and Dim Gray, indicating that it does not have the lowest median value."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_96216-train.png",
        "claim": "The values of other colors may vary significantly at different points on the x-axis.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "Without specific data points or a clear trend line for each color across the entire x-axis, it is impossible to determine how the values of other colors compare to Green at various intervals. This lack of detailed information prevents a definitive conclusion about the relative values."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_99722-train.png",
        "claim": "Dark Gold does not intersect with Turquoise.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows the trends of various colors over the x-axis. The line representing Dark Gold remains consistently below the line for Turquoise throughout the range of the x-axis, indicating that they do not intersect at any point."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_80487-train.png",
        "claim": "Cadet Blue intersects Olive Drab at multiple points.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "The chart visually shows that the data points for Cadet Blue and Olive Drab overlap at certain x-axis values, indicating that they do intersect. This contradicts the claim that they do not intersect."

        "image": "figureQA_96310-train.png",
        "claim": "The overall performance of Web Maroon compared to other colors cannot be determined without additional context on the criteria used for evaluation.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart displays various colors with their corresponding values, but it does not specify the criteria or metrics used to define 'roughness.' Without this context, it is unclear how Web Maroon's performance is assessed relative to the other colors, making it impossible to draw definitive conclusions."
    },

        "image": "figureQA_23322-train.png",
        "claim": "Dark Orange is the maximum.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows a pie chart where the segment representing Dark Orange is the largest compared to the other segments. This indicates that Dark Orange has the highest value or proportion in the data being represented, confirming that it is indeed the maximum."

        "claim": "Dodger Blue has the highest area under the curve compared to other colors.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart because the data points for Dodger Blue do not consistently reach the highest values on the y-axis compared to other colors. In fact, the chart shows that other colors, such as Web Gray and Teal, have higher values at various x-axis points, indicating that Dodger Blue does not dominate in area under the curve."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_43249-train.png",
        "claim": "The comparison between Hot Pink and Teal cannot be determined without knowing the exact values represented in the chart.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "While the chart visually represents the lengths of the bars for Hot Pink and Teal, it does not provide specific numerical values. Therefore, it is unclear whether Hot Pink is indeed greater than, less than, or equal to Teal based solely on the visual representation."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_82199-train.png",
        "claim": "Light Gold does not have the highest value.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows various lines representing different categories, with Light Gold indicated by a dotted line. Upon examining the y-axis values, it is clear that Light Gold's value remains consistently lower than other categories, such as Dark Orchid and Firebrick, which reach higher y-axis values. Therefore, the claim that Light Gold has the highest value is incorrect."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_63032-train.png",
        "claim": "Dark Khaki has the highest value among all the colors.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the chart because it suggests that Dark Khaki is the color with the highest value, while the chart visually indicates that other colors, such as Dark Slate and Light Salmon, have higher values than Dark Khaki."
    },
    {
        "image": "figureQA_66119-train.png",
        "claim": "The relationship between Blue Violet and Crimson cannot be determined without knowing the specific context or criteria for comparison.",
        "label": "Not enough information",
        "explanation": "The chart shows the values of Blue Violet and Crimson over a range of x-axis values, but it does not provide information on the specific conditions or metrics being measured. Without understanding the context or the significance of the values represented, it is impossible to definitively conclude the relationship between Blue Violet and Crimson."

        "claim": "Olive is greater than Firebrick.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The chart shows that the value for Olive is higher than that for Firebrick. Specifically, Olive has a value of approximately 90, while Firebrick has a value of around 70. This indicates that Olive is indeed greater than Firebrick."

        "claim": "Saint Laurent operated only 25 stores in Western Europe in 2020.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This sentence contradicts the information in the chart by significantly reducing the number of stores reported. The chart likely indicates a higher value, suggesting a more extensive presence in Western Europe, which is inconsistent with the claim of only 25 stores."
