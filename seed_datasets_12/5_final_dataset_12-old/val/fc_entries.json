        "claim": "The year 2020 is the only year in which the blue bar is above 5.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "By examining the data in the chart, it can be seen that the values in the 'Online' column represent the blue bars. In 2020, the value for the 'Online' column is 5.76, which is the only instance where the blue bar is above 5. This directly supports the claim that in 2020, the blue bar is above 5."

        "claim": "The expenses in million U.S. dollars in 2018 amounted to 299.3, which is the lowest among the years shown in the chart.",
        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This refutes claim contradicts the data in the chart as it inaccurately states that the expenses in 2018 were the lowest among the years provided. However, according to the chart, the expenses were actually highest in 2018 with a value of 420.9 million U.S. dollars. Therefore, the refutes claim misinterprets the actual data presented in the chart, making it incorrect based on the reported numbers."
