        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "Looking at the chart, the value for Hot Pink is 94.7, which is greater than the value for Teal at 60.4. This clearly supports the claim that Hot Pink has a higher value than Teal in the given data."

        "explanation": "The refutes claim contradicts the chart as it inaccurately states that Orange intersects Turquoise. However, based on the data presented in the chart, there is no intersection between Orange and Turquoise. Therefore, the claim directly contradicts the actual data provided in the chart."
