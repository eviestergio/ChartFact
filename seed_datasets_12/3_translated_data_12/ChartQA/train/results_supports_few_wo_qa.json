        "supports claim": "Suicide rates among individuals aged 20-39 years were significantly higher than those aged 0-19 years from 2009 to 2019.",
        "explanation": "The chart illustrates the number of suicides across different age groups from 2009 to 2019. Specifically, the data shows that the suicide rates for individuals aged 20-39 years are markedly higher than those for the 0-19 age group throughout the years. For example, in 2019, 267 suicides were reported for the 20-39 years age group compared to only 38 for the 0-19 years age group. This significant disparity in numbers clearly supports the claim."
