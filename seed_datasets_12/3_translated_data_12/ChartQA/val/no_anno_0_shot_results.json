        "supports claim": "The chart shows a significant increase in sales over the last quarter, indicating a positive trend in the company's revenue growth.",
        "explanation": "The chart visually presents data where the sales metrics start low at the beginning of the quarter but show a sharp upward trend towards the end. For instance, specific data points indicate a rise from approximately $10,000 in the first month to over $50,000 by the last month of the quarter. This clear upward trajectory illustrates a growing demand for the company's products, thereby supporting the claim that the sales have significantly increased over the last quarter."
