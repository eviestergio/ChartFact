        "explanation": "The chart illustrates the trend of population growth in millions for both male and female over the years 2009 to 2019. The data points show that the female population's values range from 5.27 million in 2009 to 5.9 million in 2019, indicating consistent growth. Meanwhile, the male population grows from 5.25 million in 2009 to 5.8 million in 2019, also reflecting an upward trend.

        "supports claim": "Electricity access rates have significantly improved in Jamaica over the period 1990 to 1999, reaching nearly universal access by the end of the decade.",
        "explanation": "The chart illustrates the trend in electricity access rates for Jamaica, Eritrea, and South Sudan from 1990 to 1999. The line representing Jamaica shows a consistent increase from 72.27% in 1990 to 86.61% in 1999, indicating a clear upward trajectory. This substantial growth reflects successful initiatives or investments in infrastructure that contributed to improving electricity access in Jamaica. In contrast, Eritrea shows a slower increase from 19.25% to 29.63%, while South Sudan's access remained stagnant at 1.32%. By highlighting Jamaica's progress, the claim draws attention to the significant improvement in electricity access captured by the data points on the chart."
