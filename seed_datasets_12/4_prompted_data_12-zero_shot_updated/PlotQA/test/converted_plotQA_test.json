        "explanation": "This statement is supported by the visual representation in the chart where the horizontal axis (X-axis) is clearly labeled with 'Year'. This indicates that the data being presented corresponds to different years, which is a common practice in time-series analysis or trend representation. The chart's labeling helps viewers understand that the values plotted are tracked over specific years."
