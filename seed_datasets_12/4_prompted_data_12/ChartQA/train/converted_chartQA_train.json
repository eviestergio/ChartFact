        "label": "Refutes",
        "explanation": "This claim refutes the chart by inaccurately stating that the highest amount spent on alcoholic drinks was in 2010. However, based on the chart data, the highest amount spent was in 2020, with a value of 25964 GBP. In 2010, the expenditure was 14879 GBP, which contradicts the claim made, showing a misinterpretation of the actual data in the chart."
