        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "This claim is validated by directly observing the chart, where the second tick mark up from the bottom clearly shows 3 distinct bars representing data points.

        "claim": "The chart effectively presents data without using grid lines.",
        "label": "Supports",
        "explanation": "The absence of grid lines in the chart enhances the clarity of the data presentation. By not including grids, the focus remains solely on the data points and trends, allowing for a more direct interpretation of the information displayed. This visual aspect helps to reduce potential distractions that grid lines might introduce, providing a cleaner and more streamlined look at the data trends and comparisons."
