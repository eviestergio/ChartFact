        "explanation": "The chart provides data on the expenses for the Green Bay Packers from 2014 to 2018, but it does not specify the reasons behind the fluctuations in expenses. Without additional context or breakdowns of the expenses, it is impossible to determine the specific factors contributing to the increase in 2017."
