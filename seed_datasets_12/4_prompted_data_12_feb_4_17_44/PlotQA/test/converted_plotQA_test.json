        "explanation": "The X-axis of the chart is clearly labeled with the term 'Years', indicating that it represents the passage of time across different years. This is visually confirmed by the horizontal axis where the years 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 are marked, supporting the claim that the X-axis is labeled 'Year'."
